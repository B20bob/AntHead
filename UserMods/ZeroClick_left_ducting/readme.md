# ZeroClick on left ducting

## Idea about this mod
This mod is started for the HexZero. <br>
The HexZero has the dual extrusions in the back, like the Voron V0.2. <br>
On the HexZero the change is made, that the gantry can move over these dual extrusions. <br>
There is that little space, that there can't be parts on the back of the toolhead, because these would collide with these Z-extrusions. <br>
This mod moves the probe to the side, to give free space on the back, to prevent this collision.
