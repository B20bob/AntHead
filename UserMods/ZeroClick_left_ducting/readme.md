# ZeroClick on left ducting
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="assets/ZeroClick_left_duct.png"></p>

## Idea about this mod
This mod is started for the HexZero. <br>
The HexZero has the dual extrusions in the back, like the Voron V0.2. <br>
On the HexZero the change is made, that the gantry can move over these dual extrusions. <br>
There is that little space, that there can't be parts on the back of the toolhead, because these would collide with these Z-extrusions. <br>
This mod moves the probe to the side, to give free space on the back, to prevent this collision. <br>

## Hardware needed for this mode
### For the AntHead
Nothing extra is needed for the AntHead, when looking at the hardware. <br>
### For the ZeroClick

Extra parts could be the parts for the dock, depends on the user choice, what to use. <br>
